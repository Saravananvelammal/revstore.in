      <li>
        The website <strong>revstore.in</strong> (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;) and the Rev mobile
        applications (together, the &ldquo;Platform&rdquo;) are owned and operated by
        <strong>Rev Technologies</strong> (&ldquo;Rev&rdquo;, &ldquo;We&rdquo;, &ldquo;Us&rdquo;, &ldquo;Our&rdquo;), a company incorporated
        under the laws of India, having its registered office at

    </ol>

    <h3 class="section">3) Role of Rev; Marketplace Nature</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rev operates an online marketplace that enables transactions between users
        and independent third-party sellers and/or service providers (&ldquo;Sellers&rdquo;).
        Rev is not a party to the contract between users and Sellers and does not
        own, produce, or endorse the products/services listed by Sellers unless
        expressly stated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unless expressly stated, Rev does not take title or possession of products.
        Delivery may be facilitated via third-party logistics partners or delivery
        agents. Any contract of sale is a strictly bipartite contract between you
        and the Seller.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="section">4) Eligibility</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>

        only with the involvement and consent of a parent/guardian.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may suspend or terminate access where legally required or where you
        violate these Terms.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="section">5) Account, Registration, and Security</h3>

      <li>
        You may need an account to use certain features. You agree to provide
        true, accurate, current, and complete information and to keep it updated.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials
        and for all activities under your account. Notify us promptly at the
        contact in Section 21 if you suspect unauthorized use.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="section">6) Permitted Use; Prohibited Conduct</h3>

      <li>
        You shall not:

          <li>misuse, disrupt, or overburden the Platform or interfere with other users;</li>
          <li>upload or transmit any harmful code, infringing, defamatory, obscene, or unlawful content;</li>

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="section">7) Products, Services, Pricing, and Promotions</h3>
    <ol>

        Listings, descriptions, images, availability, prices, fees (including

        or controlled by Sellers unless stated otherwise. Such information is
        subject to change without notice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rankings or recommendations may be influenced by factors such as relevance,
        popularity, user behavior, availability, and/or paid promotions. Sponsored
        or &ldquo;promoted&rdquo; placements, where applicable, will be identified in-app.
      </li>
      <li>
        Errors may occur; we and/or Sellers reserve the right to cancel orders

      <li>
        Risk of loss passes to you upon delivery to the address or per your
        delivery instructions (including &ldquo;leave at door&rdquo;). If you choose
        unattended delivery, you accept associated risks (e.g., theft, spoilage).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cash-on-Delivery (if offered) requires payment in full at delivery; failure
        to pay may result in cancellation and applicable fees.
