    </p>

    <p>

      laws of India, having its registered office at
      <strong>No. 173, Bhavani Nagar, Ayapakkam, Chennai – 600077,

      <strong>revstore.in</strong> and the mobile applications, collectively referred to
      as the <strong>“Platform”</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By accessing or using the Platform, creating a user account (“Account”), or
      availing any service through the Platform, you acknowledge that you have
      read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Notice. If you do
      not agree, please do not use the Platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are under 18 years of age, you may use the Platform only under the
      supervision of a parent or legal guardian who accepts this Privacy Notice
      on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">1) Scope and Relationship to Terms</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Notice describes how we collect, use, store, disclose, transfer,
      and protect information on the Platform. It forms an integral part of, and
      shall be read with, our Terms of Use (“Terms”). Capitalised terms used but
      not defined here have the meanings given in the Terms. This Notice does not

      controlled by us.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communications &amp; OTP:</strong> information contained in your
        communications with us (email, phone, in-app chat). If you choose, we may
        auto-read one-time passwords (OTPs) strictly to complete verification;
        we do not access other message contents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cookies/SDKs/Similar Tech:</strong> we use cookies and mobile SDKs
        to authenticate users, remember preferences, measure performance, and

        disabled.
      </li>

    <h3 class="section">3) Lawful Bases and How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>
      We process information where permitted by applicable law (including the
      Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDP Act”), the Information
      Technology Act, 2000 and rules thereunder), based on one or more of:
      your consent, performance of a contract, compliance with legal obligations,
      and our legitimate interests (such as security, fraud prevention, improving
      services).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Purposes include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>creating and managing your Account; verifying identity and eligibility;</li>
      <li>providing, operating, and improving the Platform and related services;</li>
      <li>processing orders, payments, refunds; enabling logistics and delivery features;</li>
      <li>personalising content, recommendations, and promotions (with opt-out options);</li>
      <li>sending service/transactional messages, important updates, and security alerts;</li>
      <li>detecting, investigating, and preventing fraud, abuse, or violations of the Terms;</li>
      <li>analytics, debugging, and product research (including anonymised/aggregated reports);</li>
      <li>complying with laws, regulatory obligations, and responding to lawful requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="section">4) Payments</h3>
    <p>
      Payments are processed by third-party payment service providers. We do not
      store full card/UPI credentials on our servers. Payment providers handle
      your payment data in accordance with their own policies and applicable
      standards/laws.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">5) Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Information. We may share information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        with trusted service providers acting on our behalf under confidentiality
        and data-protection obligations (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, SMS/OTP,
        payments, logistics, customer support);
      </li>
      <li>
        with law enforcement, regulators, courts, or other authorities where
        legally required or to protect our rights, users, or the public;
      </li>
      <li>
        in connection with a business transaction (e.g., merger, acquisition,
        restructuring or sale of assets), where information may be transferred to
        the new entity subject to this or a materially similar notice;
      </li>
      <li>
        as aggregated/anonymised data that does not identify you.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We also require that any sub-processors or third-party processors to whom
      we pass your data adhere to the same or stronger data-protection obligations,
      and we may notify you of any material changes to such sub-processors via
      the Platform or email, where required by law.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">6) Cross-Border Transfers</h3>
    <p>
      We host and process data using Google Cloud Run and MongoDB Atlas. Data may
      be stored or processed outside your state/country (including outside India).
      Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards to protect your
      information consistent with this Notice and applicable laws, including
      encryption and standard contractual clauses / equivalent safeguards where
      applicable.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">7) Data Security</h3>
    <p>
      We employ administrative, technical, and organisational measures designed to
      protect information, including encryption in transit and at rest (where
      applicable), access controls, and regular monitoring. However, no system can
      be guaranteed 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the
      confidentiality of your Account credentials and promptly notifying us of any
      suspected unauthorised access.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of a data breach or security incident, we will notify you and/or
      relevant regulatory authorities as required under applicable law, within the
      timelines mandated by law.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">8) Data Retention</h3>
    <p>
      We retain Personal Information for as long as needed to fulfil the purposes
      described above, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
      enforce agreements. When no longer necessary, we delete or irreversibly
      anonymise data in a reasonable timeframe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also retain logs, metadata, system audit trails, and consent records
      for a period permitted or required by law (e.g., for compliance, fraud
      investigation).
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">9) Your Choices and Rights</h3>
    <p>Subject to applicable law, you may:</p>

      The Platform is not intended for children under 18 years without parental/
      guardian supervision. If we learn that a child has provided Personal
      Information without appropriate consent, we will take reasonable steps to
      delete such data.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">11) Third-Party Links and Services</h3>
    <p>
