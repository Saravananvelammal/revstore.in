    <h1>Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 25 November 2025</p>

    <p>
      REV believes in helping its customers as far as possible and therefore
      follows a liberal cancellation and refund policy. Under this policy:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within the
        <strong>same day</strong> of placing the order. However, the cancellation
        request may not be entertained if the orders have already been
        communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process
        of shipping them.
      </li>

      <li>
        REV does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like
        flowers, eatables, etc. However, a refund/replacement can be made if the
        customer establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.
      </li>

      <li>
        In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same
        to our Customer Service team. The request will be entertained once the
        merchant has checked and determined the same at their own end. This
        should be reported within the <strong>same day</strong> of receipt of the
        products.
      </li>

      <li>
        In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or
        is not as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our
        Customer Service team within the <strong>same day</strong> of receiving
        the product. The Customer Service team, after looking into your complaint,
        will take an appropriate decision.
      </li>

      <li>
        In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from
        the manufacturer, please refer the issue directly to the manufacturer as
        per the warranty terms provided with the product.
      </li>

      <li>
        In case of any refunds approved by REV, it will take
        <strong>1–2 days</strong> for the refund to be processed to the end
        customer, after the approval has been confirmed. The actual time taken
        for the amount to reflect in your account will depend on your bank or
        payment provider.
      </li>
    </ul>
